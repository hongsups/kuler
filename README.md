# Project Kuler
This repository contains codes for my data science side project, [Project Kuler](http://www.hongsup.com/kuler/).

## Adobe Kuler
- [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/) is a website where one can create and explor color themes for his/her presentation or web design. 
- Each color theme consists of 5 colors. Each theme has information about the author, number of likes, RGB color codes, etc.

## Goal summary
- Project Kuler is a data-science project I started recently.
- I scraped data from the kuler website, and by machine learning algorithms, I intended to understand why certain color combinations are more popular than others.
- For the detailed progress, please visit [my website](www.hongsup.com/kuler).

## Repository
- This repository has two files: json response of color themes I scraped (kuler_data_new.txt), and an ipython notebook file (Project Kuler.ipynb).
